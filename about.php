    <h2>About</h2>
    <div id="text_left">
      <p><strong>First Place Photography</strong>, established in 1974, has provided high-quality photography to numerous metropolitan Detroit-area clients. Weddings, family portraits, anniversaries, and other meaningful events have been photographed in an unobtrusive manner, keeping the fun and spontaneity (or solemnity) of the occasion intact.</p>
      <p>Your photographer, Mark Place, has studied Graphic and Commercial Art, attended many trade seminars on photographic specialties such as wedding photography and portraiture (by nationally renowned photographer Monte Zucker), and has won awards locally for his work. Images created by Mark have been published in such prestigious publications as &ldquo;HOUR Detroit&rdquo; (Metro Detroit√≠s premier monthly events magazine), and &ldquo;The Knot&rdquo; &mdash; a national guide for all aspects of wedding preparation. Mark is a member of the Professional Photographers 
        of America.</p>
      <p>First Place Photography is a full-time, full-service photographic entity, with one goal: to provide clients with high-quality product at a fair and reasonable cost.</p>

      <p>Professional equipment is used for all engagements. When an event calls for film, medium format (2 1/4&rdquo; negative size) cameras are used, with ample backup equipment always on hand. Film is either Fuji Professional or Kodak Portra. </p>
      <p>If the event is to be photographed digitally, professional digital SLR cameras are used. Black and white, and sepia images are available on request. Check out our  section to view some of the great effects that can be done digitally.</p>
      <p>We would love to have you visit our office and see why our experience and quality will help you cherish your wedding day or other event for years to come.</p>
      <p>Our office hours are very convenient for busy clients. Please call us weekdays at <strong>(586) 484-8194</strong> and arrange for your day or evening appointment.</p>
