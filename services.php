      <p><strong>First Place Photography</strong> offers a full line of photographic services, including wedding Collections, family portraits and location sittings. We have Wedding Collections for all budgets, starting with a “ceremony-only” collection, for seven hundred dollars. This coverage is for the bride and groom that are looking only for photographs at the location of the ceremony, with coverage before, during, and after the wedding ceremony, for a total of three hours.</p>
      <p>Other Collections will provide additional location coverage, more time, and, of course, more photographs. Full coverage packages start at approximately $1,400. However, we find that our typical client usually invests between $1,700 and $2,500 for complete photographic coverage. Full coverage includes photographs at the bride's home, church, outdoor locations and reception. We offer both traditional and photojournalist photography styles, in both film and digital formats.</p>

      <p>Our Premiere Collection will capture everything possible on the wedding day, with unlimited all day/evening coverage, premium albums, and multiple locations. There are intermediate Collections as well. We understand that everyone has a budget, and we try to offer a variety of packages which accommodate budget restrictions.</p>
      <p>Family Portrait sessions are typically done in an environmental setting, whether it be at the client’s home or an outdoor location (weather permitting). We have a number of packages available, always with the option of adding additional photographs to the package.</p>
      <p>Additional services, such as senior portraits, anniversary parties, classic vehicles, and other events not covered in the catalogue of services can be defined as a custom package, based on locale, time, and your specific requirements. Please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a> for details.</p>
